Webpage Project for UGC (User Generated Content) from Games
This repository is for a webpage designed to provide a platform for users to create, share, and interact with user-generated content (UGC) from various games like Gran Turismo 7, Minecraft, Lego 2K Drive, and many others. The goal is to provide a highly modular system that allows users to easily browse, add, and view content specific to the games they enjoy.

Features
React, Redux, Bootstrap, and Axios for building and managing the user interface and interactions.
Components: Developed using a modular approach, with reusable components (e.g., buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, inputs) placed into different sections and styles to maintain the structure and ensure easy customization.
Search Functionality: A search function will be implemented that catalogues the most used search words. These will be indexed for quicker search results and will make the platform more responsive.
Monetization System: Includes badges, memberships, and rewards for content creation (e.g., tutorial videos reaching certain thumbs up numbers).
Badge System: Users earn badges based on content achievements, such as the first tutorial to hit 1000 thumbs up.
Sharing Features: Allows users to share course cards, reviews, and tutorials across platforms. When a user creates a review, they can receive an email with the review, which they can share with others.


Search Functionality
The search function in this application will allow users to look for content by specific keywords, and it will track and index the most frequently used search terms for quicker search results. This system ensures that when users perform searches, they will get more efficient and faster responses.

Key Features of the Search Function:
Search History Tracking: Catalogs the most frequently searched terms.
Indexing: Indexed search terms will be loaded to optimize query times.
Results Optimization: With indexed words, users can find their desired content faster.
Monetization System
The site will offer a monetization system with badges, special rewards, and content-sharing features. For example:

Tutorial Videos: Achieving 1000 thumbs up on your first tutorial earns you a badge.
Membership Rewards: Users who create high-quality tutorials can receive rewards like free membership for reaching certain milestones.
User-Generated Content (UGC)
This project focuses on showcasing and sharing in-game created content, such as:

Short, Long, and Custom Forms for adding content (such as tutorials, reviews, etc.).
Reviews: Users can submit custom, long, or short reviews for content related to various games.
Content Uploading: Users can upload their content in various categories, categorized per game, for example, GT7, Minecraft, and Lego 2K Drive.
Notes on Components and Pages
Each page and component in the application has been built to have clear functionality, and to make the system easy to maintain, it will include notes or comments highlighting its specific behavior. The key functionality notes are outlined below:

Components:
Each component will have clear comments indicating its purpose, inputs, and outputs.
Example: The Button component will include notes like, "Handles user interaction for form submission."
Pages:
Every page should include a description of its function at the top. For example, for a page displaying a gameâ€™s tutorials, the note will explain that this page is dedicated to showing user-generated tutorials for the selected game.
Specific notes will explain dynamic behaviors, such as how content is fetched and displayed for specific games.
Example Notes:
Main_Content.jsx: This page will have a note stating that it handles the dynamic rendering of different types of user-generated content (UGC), from reviews to tutorials, and explains how data from Redux or APIs are handled here.

NavBar.jsx: The NavBar components will have notes like, "Displays navigation options based on user login status" to clarify the different states of the navbar, depending on whether the user is logged in or not.
